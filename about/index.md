If you've found this site in a Google search for my username you'll probably know that I work as a Solutions Architect for the Secure Innovation team
at [CGI](https://www.cgi.com) in the UK, and that I sometimes post on Instagram and Facebook, but not very often, because I have concerns over permanency of material on social media sites, and on who it gets shared with. 

I'm very lucky to work a four-day week which gives me time to work on side projects. One of them is improving our camper van, [lilleflyttehytta](https://instagram.com/lilleflyttehytta) and the other is learning how to sail a yacht called Paloma that we bought in August 2023, really to compensate for a
gradual ramping down of sea kayaking trips (which are now mostly expedition-type holidays because at least three people are required from a safety 
perspective.  I learnt how to sail a dinghy as a child and always considered the next step to be too expensive and maintenance-intensive, but I've come to
appreciate that sailing and living on a small yacht is feasible if done within the right parameters - I am a devoted follower of [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) and on reading his book [The Maintenance Race](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-maintenance-race) I decided that I
wanted to sail like another long-time hero of mine, [Bernard Moitessier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Moitessier), although nowhere near as far.
But I wanted to try for myself, and not just re-read his excellent The Long Way.

In setting up this site, I wanted to preserve some notes of previous trips and with pointers to boat and van-based lifestyles. The means to serve pages 
was generously provided by Clay Harmon, creator of the *Tufte-Jekyll* theme, which is inspired by the  work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials. 

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), if you are interested in keeping a blog of your own.
